> [!CAUTION]
> It is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** to refer to a graphics library explicitly in your main program. Only your dynamic libraries can do so. This also applies to your games.


> [!NOTE]
> These dynamic libraries can be seen as plug-ins providing various capabilities to your main program. In **NO CASE** must graphics libraries influence the game logic. Game libraries must not contain any information about screen rendering or low-level events.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You MUST **NOT** differentiate your libraries. Each of your libraries MUST be handled in a generic and uniform manner. Keep genericity!
